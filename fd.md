When first connecting to the server, we login with the credentials and are displayed with a terminal. the first thing to do is check whats in the current directory. This is done by the ```ls``` command. Trying to display the contents of the file we are unsuccessful.
```
fd@prowl:~$ ls
fd  fd.c  flag
fd@prowl:~$ cat flag
cat: flag: Permission Denied
```
From here, we can open up the ```fd.c``` file to see how ```fd``` works. 
```
fd@prowl:~$ cat fd.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
char buf[32];
int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]){
  if(argc<2){
    printf("pass argv[1] a number \n");
    return 0;
  }
  int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234;
  int len = 0;
  len = read(fd, buf, 32);
  if(!strcmp("LETMEWIN\n", buf){
    printf("good job :)\n");
    system("/bin/cat flag");
    exit(0);
  }
  printf("learn about Linux file IO\n");
  return 0;
}
```
Based on the above code we see that it takes our argument, parses it into a number using ```atoi()```, subtracting `0x1234 (4660 in decimal)` from it, then finally saves that final number as our file descriptor. 2 more lines down and we see that this program reads from that file descriptor and stores the string in `buf` which is later compared to "LETMEWIN\n". Since we want to input a string as our overall goal, but can only enter a number through the programs argument, we have to get `fd = 0` to allow for stdin. If we use 4660 as `argv[1]`, our resulting `fd` variable will be 0.

This allows us to now enter a string to be stored in `buf`. In order to get the flag our `buf` must contain "LETMEWIN\n". After entering that the flag is shown.
```
fd@prowl:~$ ./fd 4660
LETMEWIN
good job :)
mommy! I think I know what a file descriptor is!!
```
As you can see the final flag is 
`mommy! I think I know what a file descriptor is!!`
